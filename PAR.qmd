LECS PAR and light sensor data.

LECS has a surface PAR sensor (LICOR) on the surface buoy
and a submerged sensor on the lander (PAR Odyssey).
Underwater sensor is a logger and should produce
calibrated (?) PAR. 
The LICOR sensor is in units of counts which represent voltage.
It needs calibration, either from the factory data sheet or
by cross-calibration with another sensor.

Matt has a paper on calibrating these and HOBO light sensors:
