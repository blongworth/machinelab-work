This directory contains LECS data resampled to 4Hz and converted
to input files for flux calculation in MATLAB. The input files are periods
between lander repositioning and have had intervals shorter than 15 minutes
removed. 
It also contains the MATLAB flux script, set up for batch input,
a shell script to coordinate running all input files, and output
files containing fluxes and cumulative fluxes.
